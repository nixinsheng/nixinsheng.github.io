再见！

-----


Slip inside the eye of your mind

窥视你的内心

Don't you know you might find

你知道吗，你或许会找到

A better place to play

一个更美好的地方

You said that you'd never been

你说你从未去到那里

But all the things that you've seen

但是你所见到的万千事物

Will slowly fade away

都在渐渐消逝褪色



So I'll start the revolution from my bed

所以我要从梦中醒来

Cos you said the brains I had went to my head

因为你们说我的思想已经冲昏了我的头脑

Step outside the summertime's in bloom

外面夏日的花香馥郁

Stand up beside the fireplace

仿佛站在温暖的炉火旁

Take that look from off your face

别摆着你那副臭脸

You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

你永远无法让我燃烧的心熄灭



So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by

于是，莎莉愿意等待 当我们继续踏上征途时，她知道挽留已经太晚

Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say

她魂不守舍 但是我听到你说 不要为往事而懊恼



Take me to the place where you go

带我去你要去的地方

Where nobody knows if it's night or day

那里无人知晓 无论是夜晚还是白天

Please don't put your life in the hands

请不要把你生命的意义

Of a Rock n Roll band

押注在摇滚乐团上

Who'll throw it all away

他们只会挥霍掉一切



I'll gonna start the revolution from my bed

所以我要从梦中醒来

Cos you said the brains I had went to my head

因为你们说我的思想已经冲昏了我的头脑

Step outside the summertime's in bloom

外面夏日的花香馥郁

Stand up beside the fireplace

仿佛站在温暖的炉火旁

Take that look from off your face

别摆着你那副臭脸

Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

你永远无法让我燃烧的心熄灭



So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as she's walking on by

于是，莎莉愿意等待 当她上路时，她知道为时已晚

My soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say

我为她失魂 但是我听到你说 不要为往事而懊恼



So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by

At least not today

至少今天别这样
