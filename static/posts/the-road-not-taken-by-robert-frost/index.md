#  The Road not taken By Robert Frost 未选之路

今天被同事问起怎么会来到学院工作的，我随意回答几句，后来想想略有惆怅，想起了以前老师念给我们听的这首诗《未选之路》。


Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

And sorry I could not travel both

And be one traveler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I could

To where it bent in the undergrowth;

黄色的林里两路分道，

可惜身为一旅人，我不

能踏上两条，久立寂寥

对其中一支极目远眺

直至其蜿蜒入林深处。



Then took the other, as just as fair,

And having perhaps the better claim,

Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

Though as for that the passing there

Had worn them really about the same,

踏上另一条，不失偏颇，

也许是条更好的选择，

因它绿茵曾等待被踏过；

尽管就走过的足迹说，

两者其实是一样颜色，



And both that morning equally lay

In leaves no step had trodden black.

Oh, I kept the first for another day!

Yet knowing how way leads on to way,

I doubted if I should ever come back.

都曾在那清早被落叶

覆盖，未被脚印污染。

留下的第一条来日再约！

但知道路路终究相接，

我安知我是否应该复还。



I shall be telling this with a sigh

Somewhere ages and ages hence:

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—

I took the one less traveled by,

And that has made all the difference.

一声长叹，我将此诉说

自此不知是何年何月：

树林中两路分道，而我-

曾选人少那条走过，

这，造就了所以的差别。
